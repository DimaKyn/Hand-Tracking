In the file "HandTrackingControlClassTypeTwo.py" in one of the " elif's ",
This one:
***********************************************************
elif words[0] == "language" and words[1] == "russian":
    language = "ru-RU"
    continue
***********************************************************
    
"russian" can be changed to any desired language, to do that, change these lines:

1. words[1] = "your desired language"
2. language = "language code"  - see "https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/languages" for the full list of possible languages.

For example, If you would like to search in French:

words[1] = "french"
language = "fr-FR"

Note: The default language is english, upon exiting the Voice control mode, the voice recognition language will default back to English.
